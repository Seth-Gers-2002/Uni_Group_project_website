# Actual iteration-2 board, (see chapters 3 and 4), add your start and end dates 

Checklist: 
1. github entry timestamps
2. User stories are correct: see p39

* Assumed Velocity FROM iteration-1: 1.75 
* Number of developers: 3
* Total estimated amount of work: 60 days (20 days per developer) - 20 * 3 * 0.154 = 9 days (lose 51 days due to projected velocity), ideally 3 days of work per developer. 

User stories or tasks (see chapter 4):


After review of our product we decided to scrap certain user stories as they no longer fit concept, or current development goals

User story 7, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26, 30, 42, 44


These items will be implemented and expanded on later since we started development and decided that they should be developed later

User story 15, 24, 27

In progress:
* Task-2 (developer name or initials), date started
* ...

Completed:
* Task-3 (developer name or initials), date completed

### Burn Down for iteration-2 (see chapter 4):
Update this at least once per week
* 3 weeks left, 121 days left of work, (worked days 11 )
* 2 weeks left, 114 days lef of work, (worked days 18 )
* 1 week left, 70 days of work left (scrapped 44 days)
* final day,

velocity: estimated days / worked days 
* Actual Velocity: 11 / 7 = 1.57
