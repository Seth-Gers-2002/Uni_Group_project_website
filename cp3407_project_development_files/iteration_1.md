### Burn Down for iteration-1:
* A considerable portion of the groups time was spent on figuring out, setting up and refining the user stories
* 4 weeks left, 41 days of work
* 3 weeks left, 41 days of work
* 2 weeks left, 41 days left of work
* less than 1 week left, 32 days left of work (9 days completed)


Re-calculated Velocity:
* Actual Velocity From Iteration 1:
1. v2 = (E2/E1) * v1
2. v2 = (9/41) * 0.7 = 0.154
