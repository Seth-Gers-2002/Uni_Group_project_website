# User story title: In-app Chat Support

## Priority: 20 (Iteration 2), Was 15 (Iteration 1)
Could-Have
*Notes:* This feature is important for enhancing the customer experience. It provides immediate assistance 
without leaving the app and may be refined in later iterations.

## Estimation:
* Aaron: 5 days
* Seth: 2 days
* Harrison: 4 days 

## Assumptions:
- Integrates with an existing messaging service or a custom backend.
- Real-time updates and persistent conversation storage are required.
- Users must have a stable internet connection.

## Description:
**Description-v1:**  
As a customer, I want an in-app chat support feature so that I can quickly get assistance or ask questions without needing to leave the app.

**Description-v2:**  
The web application will include a dedicated chat interface that connects users to support agents. Chat history should be stored and retrievable for future reference.

## Tasks:
1. **Design the Chat UI Component:** Create a mockup for the chat interface. 
2. **Integrate a Messaging API:** Use a service like Firebase, AWS AppSync, or another chat service. 
3. **Set Up Backend Storage:** Develop endpoints and database schema for storing chat histories. 
4. **Testing:** Verify real-time communication and persistence. 

# UI Design:
* (New, not in the textbook) 
* Many user stories are connected to a User interface.
* Insert a mockup design screenshot using any prototyping tools, e.g. [https://ninjamock.com/](https://ninjamock.com/)

# Completed:
* (New, not in the textbook) 
* Insert screenshots of completed. 
* If you have multiple versions (changes between iteractions), show them all.
