# User story title: Service Provider Security Check

## Priority: 10
Must-Have
Justification: It is extremely important that measures be taken to ensure that all service providers signing up
are legitimate businesses otherwise this could have serious legal consequences for the project (negligence).

## Estimation:
* Aaron:
* Seth:
* Harrison:

## Assumptions (if any):
* New service provider accounts will require a valid ABN number
* TOS disclaimer (exclaiming checks have been made but lone actors within a business may act maliciously should they
suddenly choose to. In such an event the service provider will assume responsibility)

## Description:

Description-v1: As a customer, I want to know that all service providers available on the website have undergone
relevant checks to ensure they are legitimate businesses, so that I can access services knowing they will be honoured.
