# User story title: Real-Time Job Notifications

## Priority: 20 (Iteration 1) 
*Notes:* This is critical for ensuring service providers are immediately aware of any booking changes, 
which helps them manage their schedules effectively.

## Estimation:
* Aaron: 2 days
* Seth:
* Harrison:

## Assumptions:
- Customers are willing to rate and provide feedback after each service.
- The ratings and reviews will be stored and used to calculate aggregate scores for service providers.
- The feature must be integrated with the existing user and service provider profiles.

## Description:
**Description-v1:**  
As a customer, I want to be able to rate and provide feedback after a cleaning service so that I can help other users make informed decisions and enable service providers to improve their offerings.

**Description-v2:**  
After each service, a rating form (e.g., 1-5 stars and a comment box) will be presented. Submitted ratings will be aggregated and displayed on the service provider's profile, influencing future booking decisions.

## Tasks:
1. **Design the Feedback Form UI:** Develop a simple and intuitive form for rating and commenting. 
2. **Backend Integration:** Create endpoints for storing and retrieving feedback data in the database. 
3. **Display Aggregated Ratings:** Update service provider profiles to show average ratings and recent comments. 
4. **Testing:** Verify that ratings are stored correctly and the UI updates in real time. 

# UI Design:
* (New, not in the textbook) 
* Many user stories are connected to a User interface.
* Insert a mockup design screenshot using any prototyping tools, e.g. [https://ninjamock.com/](https://ninjamock.com/)

# Completed:
* (New, not in the textbook) 
* Insert screenshots of completed. 
* If you have multiple versions (changes between iteractions), show them all.
