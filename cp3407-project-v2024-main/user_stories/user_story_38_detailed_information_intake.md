# User story title: Comprehensive Customer Information Collection System

## Priority: 15
Could have:
A more detailed system that collects all the required customer information, ensuring that nothing is missed. This will serve both the cleaner and admin in planning and executing the job properly.

## Estimation: e.g. 2 days
Any notes on estimation:
* Aaron: 2 days
* Seth:  2 days
* Harrison: 2 days 

## Assumptions (if any):
- The system will expand on the basic intake by including secondary fields such as service preferences, special instructions, and scheduling details.
- Data captured is stored centrally and can be reviewed or amended later if needed.
- Both cleaners and admins will have appropriate access to this detailed information.

## Description:
A comprehensive form or tab that enables detailed collection of customer information. In addition to the initial data, this system gathers all necessary details to fully prepare for each job. This ensures that both the cleaning team and the administrators have all the information needed to perform their tasks effectively.

Description-v1:
A multi-section form that walks the user through various data points (personal details, job requirements, scheduling, special instructions, etc.), ensuring all relevant customer and job details are captured and stored for future reference.

## Tasks, see chapter 4:
- Design a multi-section form layout detailing various customer and job-related information.
- Develop frontend components with clear segmentation for data fields.
- Implement advanced form validation and dynamic field display (if certain answers lead to additional questions).
- Develop robust backend endpoints for secure data storage and retrieval.
- Integrate data review features for both cleaners and administrators.
- Perform user testing to ensure that the form covers all required fields effectively.

# UI Design:
- A segmented, intuitive interface that guides the user through filling out detailed information.
- Use of visual cues (e.g., progress indicators, tooltips) to assist with the data entry process.
- Ensure a consistent design with the rest of the application for seamless integration.
