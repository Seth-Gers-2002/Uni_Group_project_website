* Seth: x
* Harrison: x

## Assumptions (if any):
- The system is integrated with supplier APIs or in-house purchasing modules.
- There is an established workflow for reordering supplies and updating inventory automatically.
- Security and payment processing measures are in place for ordering transactions.

## Description:
An advanced feature that streamlines the ordering process by allowing cleaners or administrators to place orders directly from the supply tracker interface. Once an order is placed, the system automatically updates the inventory once the items are received, reducing manual effort and preventing delays.

Description-v1:
A one-click ordering function integrated within the supply tracking module that lets users order items directly into storage, with automated updates to the inventory, ensuring supplies are replenished efficiently.

## Tasks, see chapter 4:
- Research and integrate necessary supplier APIs or develop an in-house ordering system.
- Design UI components for the ordering interface integrated into the supply tracker.
- Implement backend logic to manage order placements, confirmations, and inventory updates.
- Develop security protocols for handling transactions and user authentication during ordering.
- Test the full ordering flow, from initiation to inventory update.

# UI Design:
- A dedicated ordering area within the supply tracker featuring an “Order Now” button next to items flagged for reorder.
- Order forms or dialogs with necessary fields (quantity, supplier details, etc.).
- Responsive design with clear call-to-action buttons and order status displays.
