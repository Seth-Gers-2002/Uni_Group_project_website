* Harrison: x

## Assumptions (if any):
- The system has access to third-party payment gateways and supplier APIs.
- Admin users are authorized to process purchases through the platform.
- Security measures for handling transactions are robust and documented.

## Description:
A comprehensive solution that streamlines the purchasing process. Once stock requests are submitted and approved, the system enables admins to place orders directly with suppliers. Upon successful purchase, the inventory system automatically updates the stock levels, reducing manual effort and errors.

Description-v1:
A system that connects with external vendor APIs to handle payments and order processing. When an order is successfully placed, the system updates the inventory accordingly and provides real-time status tracking to the admin.

## Tasks, see chapter 4:
- Research and integrate with relevant payment gateways and supplier APIs.
- Develop backend logic to handle order placement, processing, and error management.
- Create UI components for managing and tracking orders.
- Implement automated stock updates following order completion.
- Conduct comprehensive testing of the end-to-end purchasing process, including security and error handling.

# UI Design:
- Design a dashboard section dedicated to purchase orders and order history.
- Embed real-time tracking and status updates for each order, integrated with purchase confirmations and alert notifications.
