# User story title: Streamlined Login Experience

## Priority: 20
Could have:
An enhanced login process on the landing page that is optimized for ease-of-use, enabling employees to sign in quickly and remain logged in, thus minimizing downtime and distractions.

## Estimation: e.g. 2 days
Any notes on estimation:
* Aaron: 2 days
* Seth: 2 days
* Harrison: 2 days

## Assumptions (if any):
- The system supports multiple user profiles with role-based sign-in options.
- Additional features like "Remember Me", single sign-on, or auto-session renewal are supported to streamline the experience.
- Users may be impacted by complex logins, so feedback mechanisms for errors and delays are in place.

## Description:
An optimized login experience designed to reduce friction and enhance reliability. By incorporating features that keep the login process quick and straightforward, employees at Scrubit Clean can avoid repeated logouts and the hassles of a cumbersome authentication process.

Description-v1:
