# User story title: Supply Tracker â€“ Location Tracking

## Priority: 30
Could have:
A feature that shows the physical location and access details for each supply item so that the cleaner can easily identify where supplies are stored and retrieve them quickly.

## Estimation: e.g. 2 days
Any notes on estimation:
* Aaron: x
* Seth: x
* Harrison: 2 days

## Assumptions (if any):
- Each supply item has an associated location attribute in the inventory system.
- Basic mapping or location diagrams of storage areas are available.
- The system supports updating and displaying location details dynamically.

## Description:
A dedicated section in the supply tracker that not only shows the available supply quantities but also their physical locations (e.g., shelf, room, bin). This helps cleaners save time by knowing exactly where to find the items they need.

Description-v1:
A tab that displays the storage details of each supply item alongside inventory counts, enabling quick identification of where supplies are stored and how to access them.

## Tasks, see chapter 4:
- Enhance the inventory database to include location fields for each supply.
- Design and implement UI elements to display location information alongside supply details.
- Develop backend endpoints to retrieve and update supply location data.
- Integrate mapping or visual diagrams for storage areas if available.
- Test the location display functionality for accuracy and usability.

# UI Design:
- A user-friendly panel showing each supply item with its location details (e.g., section labels or a mini-map).
- Clear labels and icons to indicate storage areas.
- Responsive design for easy navigation on different devices.
