Any notes on estimation:
* Aaron: x
* Seth: x
* Harrison: x

## Assumptions (if any):
- The job details page already displays a valid address.
- Cleaners often use external mapping or GPS applications which require manual entry or copy-paste.
- A single-click solution is sufficient to address this usability need.

## Description:
An intuitive functionality built into the job details page, allowing professional cleaners to copy the job address with a single click. This reduces the need for manual re-entry, streamlining the process to access external navigation tools and plan travel efficiently.

Description-v1:
A one-click copy feature integrated into the job details interface that places the job address onto the clipboard. This easily enables cleaners to paste the address into their GPS or mapping apps, saving time and minimizing errors.

## Tasks, see chapter 4:
- Develop a distinct UI element (e.g., a copy icon/button) adjacent to the job address.
- Implement clipboard-copy functionality using JavaScript (or relevant framework-specific libraries).
- Provide visual confirmation (like a tooltip or color change) to indicate successful copying.
- Test across multiple browsers and devices to ensure consistent behavior and usability.

# UI Design:
- Incorporate a clearly visible copy button next to the displayed address.
- Include on-hover text or a tooltip such as "Copy address for navigation" for clarity.
- Ensure the button's design aligns with the overall job details page layout.
